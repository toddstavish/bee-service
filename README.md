# Building Extraction Evaluation (Bee) Service

A RESTful web service to perform polygon comparison for building extraction evaluation. The service is implemented in Python using an Azure App Service Web App. This repository has been tested to continuously deploy to Azure via GIT.

# Python sample for Azure App Service - Django

This is a Python web app built on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework that you can deploy
to Azure App Service.

This code is generated by [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/python-vs.aspx)
from the default Django template. The Visual Studio files have been removed.

To learn how to deploy this starter web app to App Service in a few minutes, go to
[Get started with web apps in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-get-started/).
